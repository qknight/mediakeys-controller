what is this?
=================
this software parses the /dev/input/eventX devices in order to capture certain events:
 - volume up
 - volume down
 - volume mute/unmute

i've adapted the source from [1].

how to use
=================
 1. type make
 2. use as root: ./input_parser /dev/input/event3
 3. you can use other events as /dev/input/event2 instead, just look whats there in /var/log/Xorg.0.log
 4. finally use the daemon script which will parse the events and issue scripts on occurance
    ./mediakeys-controller

how it SHOULD work:
 - open all /dev/input/events it can find, only use keyboards
 - hal monitoring of devices
 - if new devices are added they are also added
 - if devices are removed from the system, they are also removed
